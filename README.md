# Overview
In recent years, there has been a notable surge in both participation and performance in marathons, leading to an intensified investigation into the elements that affect outcomes in these marathon races. Collaborating with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, this study is designed to evaluate how environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed impact marathon performance across genders.

# Goals and Objectives
* Examine effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women.
*  Explore the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender.
* Identify the weather parameters (WBGT, Flag conditions, temperature, etc) that have the largest impact on marathon performance.


# Data
The dataset comprises performance data from five major marathons—Boston, New York, Chicago, Twin Cities, and Grandma's. It includes associated weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and WBGT, along with air quality metrics like ozone levels expressed in parts per million (PPM).

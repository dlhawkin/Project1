# Introduction 

```{r, eval= FALSE}
# Currently, there has been an increase in marathon participation and performance in the past two decades. Collaborating with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matther Ely from Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, we will examine the impact of environmental conditions, like temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind on marathon performance in men and women. Studies have shown that endurance exercise is degraded with increasing environmental temperature, and the decline in performance is associated with warmer temperatures. Studies have shown that marathon runners prefer cooler temperatures than warmer temperatures due to the body regulating an enormous amount of heat and are likely to overheat in warmer temoeratures.Competing in cooler and desirable weather conditions, can reduce heat exhaustion and heat strokes which are very common in warmer conditions.
```
In recent years, marathon participation and performance have seen a marked increase, prompting a deeper exploration into the factors influencing outcomes in these endurance events. In collaboration with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, this study aims to assess the impact of environmental condition like temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed on marathon performance in both male and female marathon runners.

This study will focus on three aims. The first aim is to examine the effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women. Our second aim is to explore the impacts of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender. The last aim is to identify  (WBGT, Flag conditions, temperature, etc) that have the largest impact on marathon performance. I hypothesize that increasing environmental temperatures and unfavorable weather conditions will have a negative impact on marathon performance.


# Methods 

## Preprocessing 
The initial exploratory analysis was conducted to identify patterns and relationships among key variables. During preprocessing, it was observed that `Race (0=Boston, 1=Chicago, 2=NYC, 3=TC, 4=D)` corresponds to the `Race` variable in the *course_record* dataset, while `Sex (0 = F, 1 = M)` corresponds to the `Gender` variable. To ensure consistency, the `Sex` and `Race` variables were renamed to `Gender` and `Race`.

Further review revealed discrepancies in how some marathon races were coded. For instance, while one dataset used numeric codes (e.g., `0` for Boston), another dataset used letter codes (e.g., `B` for Boston). To standardize these variables, the race codes were recoded from `0` to `B`, `1` to `C`, `3` to `TC`, and `4` to `D`. Additionally, the binary outcomes for `Gender` were modified to align across datasets, with `0` recoded as `M` for male and `1` as `F` for female.

Variable names were then systematically renamed for clarity and consistency with the codebook. After completing these preprocessing steps, the data were merged by `Race`, `Gender`, and `Year`, ensuring that variables from the left dataset were retained, while integrating other variables that were not common across datasets.To ensure precise measurement of Run Times, the initial step involved converting the course records to seconds. A new variable was established to calculate the actual runtime and marathon duration for each participant in seconds, defined by the formula: Runtimes = Race_Seconds * (1 + (Percent CR / 100)). 

To begin with, we will observe the data and notice any commonalities within the variables. We begin our data preprocessing by noticing that`Race (0=Boston, 1=Chicago, 2=NYC, 3=TC, 4=D)` corresponds to the `Race` variables in the course_record data set.

## Missingness
The raw data used for this analysis consisted of 11,564 rows and 14 columns. To begin this analysis, I got the sum of missing values from the dataset by columns. From this analysis, it was observed that the variables Flag, Dry Bulb Temp C, Wet Bulb Temp C, Percent Relative Humidity, Black Globe Temp C, Dew Point in C, Wind Speed, and Wet Bulb Globe Temp contained missing data. The missing data were examined using the naniar package in R to determine the percentage missing and available in the data. Following this procedure, each of these columns was found to have 491 missing values, totaling 4,419 missing values overall, with a 4.25 missingness percentage. To further quantify the extent of missingness, the `naniar package` in R was employed to calculate the percentage of missing and available data.The missing data represent only 2.2% of the dataset, while 97.2% of the data remains well-represented. Therefore,these missing data properties were from remove further analysis.

The preprocessing of the marathon dataset and air quality involved several steps to ensure data compatibility. Therefore, race names were standardized and column names adjusted in the marathon_dates dataset to align with those in the course_record_project1 data frame. Dates were formatted  to ("YYYY-MM-DD") to facilitate time-based operations and comparisons and the cleaned *marathon_dates* data was merged with the *course_record_project*1 using a left join based on `Race` and `Year`.

The *aqi_values* data was updated to maintain consistency with the marathon data, standardizing race names and converting dates to a uniform format. Unnecessary columns were removed, and the average ozone concentration, measured over an 8-hour period, was calculated and summarized by `Race, Year, and Date`.Finally, this processed air quality data was merged with the *course_record_project1*data frame, combining marathon and air quality data to further analyze the impact of air quality on marathon performances.

# Results
## Aim 1: Examine effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women.
In the **Effects of Age on Marathon Performance in Men and Women** visualization, we observe the marathon performance (measured in runtimes) of men and women across a wide age range, from 14 to 91 years. Based on the data, there is a clear decrease in runtimes up to approximately 25 years of age, indicating improved performance in both men and women during their younger years, with peak performance typically occurring in the mid-twenties. This pattern signifies that younger participants, particularly those in their mid-twenties or younger, perform better in marathons compared to older participants.

After reaching this peak, there is a noticeable and steady increase in runtimes, suggesting a decline in performance as age advances. When comparing genders, men consistently demonstrate faster runtimes across all ages. While both men and women exhibit similar trends in declining performance with age, the slope of decline is steeper for women, particularly around the ages of 60-65. This indicates that the negative effects of aging on marathon performance are more pronounced in women during later life stages.

Overall, the performance gap between genders widens with increasing age, with men generally maintaining faster runtimes compared to women, especially in older age groups. This widening gap highlights the greater impact of aging on female marathon runners in terms of performance decline.

In the **Marathon Performance Summary Table by Age Ranges** and the **Effects of Age on Marathon Performance in Men and Women**, we noticed some summary statistics of the boxplot measurements of the marathon runners runtimes based upon their age ranges. The marathon runners were broken up into seven age groups where we noticed a somewhat balance number of people in each group. From the box plot, younger runners <15–25 tend to perform better, with lower runtimes, as evidenced by lower median values and a tighter interquartile range (IQR). This age group shows more variability (outliers) in performance for both genders.In the summary table, the mean runtime for this group is 11,039, with a median of 10,626. This group performs significantly better than older age groups, with a relatively smaller IQR of 2,917.
The 26–35 and 36–45 age groups demonstrate the best overall marathon performance. From the box plot, both men and women in these groups have lower runtimes and reduced variability (indicated by shorter whiskers and fewer outliers).
The table shows a continued decline in median runtimes as runners transition from 26–35 (median: 8,896) to 36–45 (median: 9,774). The IQR for both groups remains relatively small (~1,500), indicating more consistent performance in this age range.
Men tend to outperform women in these age groups, as seen by the lower median runtimes in the blue box plots.
The oldest age groups 66–75 and 76+ exhibit the largest runtimes and widest performance variability. The box plots show much larger IQRs, particularly for women, reflecting significant variation in performance.
In the table, the mean and median runtimes increase for the 66–75 (mean: 16,156; median: 15,552) and 76+ (mean: 21,032; median: 20,688) groups. The IQR also expands especially for the 76+ group (IQR: 5,687), indicating a broad range of abilities within this age range.The box plot demonstrates that men, even in older age groups, continue to have better performance (lower runtimes) than women. However, the performance gap between genders widens significantly after age 66, particularly in the 76+ group.

Based on the **Effects on Marathon Performance Stratified by Race, Gender, and Age Group Group Boxplot**,I examined the performances of men and women by age group by each race. In the Boston Marathon, both men and women display similar runtime performance in the <15–25 age group, with a slight male advantage in the 26–35 age group that indicates low runtimes. In the case of the 56 and older groups,there is a noticeable increase in runtimes, with women showing greater variability with larger IQR representation and longer runtimes compared to men. In the Chicago Marathon, there is an indication of great performance within the 26–35 age range having the lowest runtimes. Also there is a gradual decline in performance from  36–45 and 46–55 age groups, with a noticeable increase in runtimes for both genders.For the groups 56-65 to 76, women show more variability and slower performance than men in these age groups. The Duluth Grandma's Marathon, there is an indication of an increase in runtimes for both men and women, with women signifying higher runtimes and greater variability within the 66–75 and 76+ age groups.In the Twin Cities Marathon, runtimes increase markedly for both men and women after the age of 55. Women show higher variability and longer runtimes, particularly in the 66–75 and 76+ age groups.The New York City Marathon there is a decline in performance where the 36–45 and 46–55 groups indicates women showing slightly higher runtimes than men.

## Aim 3: Explore the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender.

To begin this analysis, a linear model will be constructed to demonstrate the relationship and impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, considering differences across age and gender. The outcome variable is the marathon runners' runtimes, analyzed in conjunction with environmental conditions, gender, and age. Upon examining the model, it was noticed that the weather parameters highlighted in blue, such as `Dry Bulb Temp C` (p=0.00001), `Percent Relative Humidity` (p=0.00001), `Black Globe Temp C` (p=0.0000), `Dew Point in C` (p=0.00003), `Solar Radiation` (p=0.0000), and `Wet Bulb Globe Temp` (p=0.00001), demonstrated statistical significance (p<0.05). Other significant parameters include the interaction terms, such as `Age (yr)` (p=0.00000), `GenderM` (p=0.00001), `Dry Bulb Temp C:Age (yr)` (p=0.00002), `Percent Relative Humidity:Age (yr)` (p=0.0000), `Black Globe Temp C:Age (yr)` (p=0.00023), `Percent Relative Humidity:Gender` (p=0.01862), `Age (yr):GenderM` (p=0.01671), `Age (yr):Wet Bulb Globe Temp` (p=0.00017), `Solar Radiation:Age (yr)` (p=0.00000), and `Dew Point in C:Age (yr)` (p=0.00706).

By analyzing the statistical significance of weather parameters, correlations with ages were observed. `Runtimes and Age` have a correlation of 0.67, indicating a strong positive relationship; as runners age, marathon runtimes tend to increase. `Dry Bulb Temp C and Black Globe Temp` share a strong correlation of 0.85, suggesting that these measurements, which gauge different aspects of weather temperature, tend to increase together. `Wet Bulb Globe Temp and Dry Bulb Temp C` exhibit a very strong correlation of 0.97, indicating that wet bulb globe temperature and dry bulb temperature often rise together. `Dew Point in C and Wet Bulb Globe Temp` have a strong correlation of 0.90, showing that higher dew points (indicating more moisture in the air) tend to be associated with higher wet bulb globe temperatures, reflecting the impact of humidity on heat stress. The correlation of 0.67 between `Age and Runtimes` is higher than most correlations with environmental conditions, suggesting that age has a stronger impact on performance than many environmental factors. This indicates that age plays a significant role in marathon performance, regardless of environmental conditions.

## Aim 3: Identify the weather parameters (WBGT, Flag conditions, temperature, etc) that have the largest impact on marathon performance.


```{r}
weather_parameters<-course_record_project1%>%
  select(Gender, `Age (yr)`, Runtimes, `Dry bulb Temp C`, `Wet bulb Temp C`,
  `Percent Relative Humidity`, `Black Globe Temp C`, `Solar Radiation`,`Dew Point in C`, 
  `Wind Speed`, `Wet Bulb Globe Temp`, age_ranges, Flag)
```

According to the **Marathon Performance by Flag Conditions Stratified by Gender**  both gender runners in Green flag conditions (indicating safer weather with lower WBGT) generally have faster runtimes, as seen by the lower median performance values compared to those running under Red, White, and Yellow flag conditions. In more severe environmental conditions, such as Red and Yellow flags, which indicate high WBGT levels, marathon performance tends to be slower, with median runtimes higher than in Green flag conditions. This suggests that higher temperatures and humidity levels significantly degrade performance. The wider spread of the box plots in Red and Yellow flags indicates greater variability in performance under these conditions, likely due to varying levels of heat tolerance among runners. While both male and female runners exhibit similar trends in response to changing flag conditions, female runners appear to have slightly higher median runtimes across all flag conditions. However, the pattern of slower performance under more severe weather conditions holds for both genders.
```{r}


# Flag Conditions on Gender
flag_exam <- ggplot(weather_parameters, aes(x = Gender, y = Runtimes, fill = Flag)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  # Use geom_boxplot for creating a boxplot

  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "White" = "white",   # Replace these with the Flag categories and the colors you want to assign
    "Green" = "green",
    "Black" = "black",

    "Red" = "red"
  )) +

```


According **Marathon Performance by Flag Conditions Stratified by Age Ranges** the younger age ranges like <15-25 and 26-35 categories, marathon performance is generally faster, with lower median runtimes and narrower interquartile ranges (IQR) across all flag conditions.The spread of runtimes in younger runners is relatively smaller across all flag conditions, suggesting more consistent performance regardless of environmental conditions. However, a small trend is observed where Red and Yellow flags (indicating harsher conditions) are associated with slightly slower runtimes compared to Green flags.n the 56-55 and 56-65 age groups, there is a noticeable increase in median runtimes, especially under Red and Yellow flag conditions. Runners in these middle-aged categories tend to perform more slowly in extreme heat, as indicated by the shift in the median and the broader spread of runtimes. The variability (as indicated by wider IQRs and longer whiskers) increases in the middle age groups, particularly under extreme conditions, suggesting that performance becomes more inconsistent as age increases and environmental conditions worsen.

In the **Weather Parameters with the Largest Impact on Marathon Performance Correlation Plot**, `Dry Bulb Temp C and Black Globe Temp C`have a strong positive correlation of (0.84). This makes sense as both variables represent temperature-related measurements. Also the `Wet Bulb Globe Temp and Dry Bulb Temp C` are also highly correlated (0.97), indicating that as dry bulb temperature increases, wet bulb temperature and black globe temperature tend to increase The correlation between `Dew Point in C and Wet Bulb Globe Temp (0.88)` is also strong, reflecting that higher dew points (indicating more moisture in the air) typically occur alongside increased wet bulb temperatures, suggesting a higher overall thermal burden.Age shows a moderate positive correlation (0.67) with Runtimes, indicating that as runners get older, their marathon runtimes tend to increase because older runners take longer to complete the marathon. This is an expected result, as endurance performance often declines with age. Based on the correlation plot, `Wind Speed` has a very low positive correlation at (0.03) on `Age (yr)` indicating that wind speed has a minimal influence on age-related variations in marathon performance.

# Conclusion and Discussion




























 

\newpage
## Supplementary Material

### Marathon Performance vs. Dry Bulb Temperature by Age Ranges
For all age groups, the effect of dry bulb temperature (ambient air temperature) on marathon performance appears to be relatively small. The scatterplots show only a slight upward trend in runtimes as dry bulb temperature increases, indicating that higher temperatures may have a mild negative impact on performance. However, the slope of the black trend lines is nearly flat for most age groups, suggesting that temperature changes in the given range (roughly 10°C to 25°C) do not strongly affect marathon runtimes.

Men and women across age groups show similar patterns in how dry bulb temperature affects performance. While women generally exhibit slightly higher runtimes than men within each age group, the impact of temperature on performance does not appear to differ significantly between the genders. This suggests that temperature influences men and women similarly, with no large gender-based differences in how environmental heat affects marathon performance.

As age increases, there is a noticeable rise in median runtimes, particularly in the older age groups 56–65, 66–75, and 76+. While the influence of temperature is small across all groups, the general increase in runtimes with age remains evident, independent of temperature. For the *76+* group, runtimes are much higher overall, but again, the effect of temperature is minimal. This suggests that age-related declines in performance are more pronounced than the impact of environmental conditions like temperature, especially in older runners.


### Marathon Performance vs. Relative Humidity Stratified by Age Ranges
Amongst all the age ranges,  the effect of relative humidity on marathon performance is minimal, as indicated by the nearly flat trend lines across the scatterplots. This suggests that variations in relative humidity, ranging from 0% to 100%, have a limited impact on marathon runtimes for both men and women.This trend is consistent across all age groups, indicating that relative humidity alone does not significantly affect performance.
In the **Marathon Performance vs. Relative Humidity Stratified by Age Ranges** men have lower runtimes than women across all age groups, but the impact of relative humidity on performance appears similar for both genders. The black trend lines, representing the overall relationship between humidity and performance, remain flat for both men and women, suggesting that both genders are equally unaffected by changes in humidity.


### Marathon Performance vs. Black Globe Temperature Stratified by Age Groups
Across most age groups, there is a slight upward trend in runtimes as Black Globe Temperature increases, especially in the 46–55, 56–65, and 66–75 age ranges. This suggests that higher Black Globe Temperatures, which represent heat stress caused by solar radiation and air temperature, may have a mild negative impact on marathon performance. Runners in these age groups experience slightly longer runtimes at higher temperatures, indicating that environmental heat does begin to affect performance, although the effect is not very strong.



### Marathon Performance vs. Wet Bulb Globe Temp Stratified by Age Groups

The trend lines in all age groups show an upward slope that indicates a small negative impact of Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) on marathon performance. As WBGT increases (which measures both temperature and humidity), runtimes tend to increase slightly, but the overall effect is minimal. The trend lines for both men and women show similar trajectories, indicating that WBGT affects both genders equally, with no significant gender-based difference in how environmental heat and humidity influence performance. The performance gap between men and women remains consistent regardless of WBGT levels.

### Marathon Performance vs. Solar Radiation Stratified by Age Groups

Across all age groups, there is little to no effect of solar radiation on marathon performance. The trend lines across different levels of solar radiation (ranging from 0 to 750 units) are mostly flat, indicating that increased solar radiation does not have a strong impact on runtimes for either gender. This indicates that solar exposure alone does not significantly affect marathon performance.

### Marathon Performance vs. Black Globe Temperature Stratified by Age Groups
The slope of the trend lines across all age groups is generally flat, suggesting that Black Globe Temperature (BGT) does not have a strong impact on marathon performance, especially in younger age groups (<15-25, 26-35, 36-45). This indicates that younger runners are more resilient to changes in environmental heat, as their performance remains fairly consistent across different temperature ranges.
